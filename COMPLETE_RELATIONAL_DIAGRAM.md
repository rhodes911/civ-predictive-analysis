**"Who will win and when?"**

```python
# Data sources: 17 core junction files
VICTORY_FEATURES = {
    'science_victory': {
        'primary': ['yield_science', 'techs', 'score_tech'],
        'supporting': ['research_priority', 'campus_buildings', 'great_scientists'],
        'competitive': ['science_rank', 'tech_advantage']
    },
    'culture_victory': {
        'primary': ['yield_culture', 'tourism', 'score_civics'],
        'supporting': ['theater_buildings', 'great_artists', 'cultural_influence'],
        'competitive': ['tourism_rank', 'influence_over_others']
    },
    'domination_victory': {
        'primary': ['land_units', 'naval_units', 'num_cities'],
        'supporting': ['military_strategy', 'combat_wins', 'captured_capitals'],
        'competitive': ['military_rank', 'territorial_control']
    },
    'diplomatic_victory': {
        'primary': ['diplo_victory_points', 'balance_favor'],
        'supporting': ['positive_relations', 'emergency_participation'],
        'competitive': ['diplomatic_rank', 'vote_influence']
    }
}

# ML Pipeline
def build_victory_predictor():
    # 1. Feature engineering from 17 core files
    features = create_temporal_features()  # Growth rates, momentum
    features += create_competitive_features()  # Rankings, advantages
    features += create_strategic_features()  # AI decision patterns
    
    # 2. Target variable: victory type from final game state
    target = determine_victory_type_and_timing()
    
    # 3. Model training
    model = XGBoostClassifier()  # Multi-class: Science/Culture/Domination/Diplomatic
    model.fit(features, target)
    
    return model
```

### **Question 2: Strategic Decision Analysis**
**"What decisions lead to success?"**

```python
# Data sources: 12 AI behavior files + outcomes
DECISION_ANALYSIS = {
    'city_management': {
        'decisions': 'AI_CityBuild.csv',  # What to build
        'outcomes': 'Player_Stats.csv',   # Population, yields
        'question': 'Which buildings/districts maximize growth?'
    },
    'military_strategy': {
        'decisions': 'AI_Military.csv',   # Unit production, positioning
        'outcomes': 'CombatLog.csv',      # Battle results
        'question': 'Which military strategies win wars?'
    },
    'research_focus': {
        'decisions': 'AI_Research.csv',   # Tech priorities
        'outcomes': 'Game_Boosts.csv',    # Tech advancement
        'question': 'Which tech paths lead to victory?'
    },
    'diplomatic_strategy': {
        'decisions': 'AI_Diplomacy.csv',  # Relationship management
        'outcomes': 'DiplomacyManager.csv', # Relationship outcomes
        'question': 'Which diplomatic approaches succeed?'
    }
}

# Analysis framework
def analyze_decision_effectiveness():
    for strategy_type, data in DECISION_ANALYSIS.items():
        # Link decisions to outcomes
        decision_outcome_pairs = join_decisions_with_outcomes(data)
        
        # Measure effectiveness
        effectiveness_scores = calculate_outcome_quality(decision_outcome_pairs)
        
        # Find patterns
        successful_patterns = identify_winning_strategies(effectiveness_scores)
        
        return successful_patterns
```

### **Question 3: Economic Optimization**
**"How do economic decisions drive victory?"**

```python
# Data sources: City + Economic files
ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS = {
    'production_optimization': {
        'inputs': ['City_BuildQueue.csv', 'AI_CityBuild.csv'],
        'outputs': ['yield_production', 'infrastructure_total'],
        'question': 'What build orders maximize productivity?'
    },
    'trade_network_efficiency': {
        'inputs': ['Game_TradeManager.csv'],
        'outputs': ['yield_gold', 'outgoing_trade_routes'],
        'question': 'Which trade strategies generate most value?'
    },
    'resource_management': {
        'inputs': ['Game_RandomEvents.csv', 'Player_Stats.csv'],
        'outputs': ['balance_gold', 'strategic_resources'],
        'question': 'How does resource control affect outcomes?'
    }
}

# Economic modeling
def build_economic_model():
    # Create economic state vectors
    economic_features = extract_economic_indicators()
    
    # Model economic growth patterns  
    growth_model = predict_economic_trajectory()
    
    # Link economic strength to victory probability
    victory_correlation = correlate_economy_with_victory()
    
    return comprehensive_economic_model
```

- ‚úÖ "Which military units are most cost-effective?"
- ‚úÖ "How should I prioritize technology research?"
- ‚úÖ "What diplomatic strategy maximizes success?"

### **Predictive Questions**
- ‚úÖ "Given current game state, what's my win probability?"
- ‚úÖ "When will the next war start and between whom?"
- ‚úÖ "Which player poses the biggest threat?"
- ‚úÖ "What victory condition should I pursue?"
