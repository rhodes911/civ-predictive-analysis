# Database Filtering Test Results

## ✅ FILTERING VERIFICATION COMPLETE!

### 📊 Key Findings:

**OLD GAME (Records created before 07:00:00):**
- 441 records across 77 turns
- 6 civilizations: England, Netherlands, Canada, Rome, Gaul, China
- Complete 77-turn epic race data

**NEW GAME (Records created 07:00:00 and later):**
- 91 records across 16 unique turns (turns 1-39, but not all turns present)
- 11 civilizations total, including some from old game
- Current Indonesia campaign in progress

### ⚠️ Important Discovery:

The NEW GAME filter is capturing **mixed data**:
- **Current Indonesia game:** Indonesia, Ethiopia, Mali, Cree, Ottoman (turns 1-15)
- **Old game overlap:** Rome, England, Netherlands, China, Canada, Gaul (turn 39 only)

This happens because the old game data from turn 39 was inserted after 07:00:00 today, making it appear as "new game" data when it's actually from the old completed race.

### 🎯 Correct Filtering Strategy:

For **current Indonesia game only**, use more precise filtering:

**Option 1: Filter by civilization**
```sql
WHERE civilization IN ('CIVILIZATION_INDONESIA', 'CIVILIZATION_ETHIOPIA', 'CIVILIZATION_MALI', 'CIVILIZATION_CREE', 'CIVILIZATION_OTTOMAN', 'CIVILIZATION_GAUL')
AND created_at::time >= '07:00:00'
```

**Option 2: Use turn range**
```sql
WHERE created_at::time >= '07:00:00' AND game_turn <= 15
```

**Option 3: Most precise - exclude the mixed turn 39**
```sql
WHERE created_at::time >= '07:00:00' AND game_turn < 39
```

### 📈 Dashboard Recommendations:

1. **Complete Historical Analysis**: Use all data (no filters)
2. **Current Game Progress**: Use `created_at::time >= '07:00:00' AND game_turn <= 15`
3. **Old Epic Race**: Use `created_at::time < '07:00:00'`

### 🔧 Superset Filter Syntax:
Use `created_at::time >= '07:00:00' AND game_turn <= 15` for current Indonesia game only.
