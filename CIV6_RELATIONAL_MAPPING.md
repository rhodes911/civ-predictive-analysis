## üéÆ **Ultimate Goal: Game Intelligence System**

This relational framework enables us to answer complex questions like:

- **"At turn 200, which player is most likely to win and by what victory type?"**
- **"What early game decisions correlate with late game success?"**
- **"How do diplomatic relationships affect military outcomes?"**
- **"Which civilizations have the strongest economic engines?"**
- **"What cultural strategies overcome military disadvantages?"**

By connecting all 45 CSV files through these relationships, we create a comprehensive game intelligence system that can provide insights into Civilization VI strategy, balance, and optimal play patterns! üöÄ
