# üéØ ML Victory Prediction Model

**Predicting Civilization VI Game Winners Using Early-Game Metrics**  
*A focused machine learning approach using your existing civ_game_data table*

---

## üéÆ **The Question We're Answering:**

**"Can we predict the final winner of a Civ VI game based on Turn 20 performance metrics?"**

This is perfect for:
- Strategic decision making in ongoing games
- Understanding which early-game strategies lead to victory
- Identifying when a game is already "decided" vs still competitive

---

## üìä **Our Data Foundation**

### **Available Data:**
- **Multiple game sessions** in your database (old epic race + current Indonesia game)
- **Turn-by-turn progression** for all civilizations
- **32 comprehensive metrics** per civilization per turn
- **Complete game outcomes** (final scores and rankings)

### **Key Metrics for Prediction:**
```sql
-- Core features we'll use for prediction
SELECT 
    game_turn,
    civilization,
    num_cities,           -- Territory expansion
    population,           -- Population growth
    techs,               -- Research progress  
    civics,              -- Cultural development
    yields_science,      -- Science per turn
    yields_culture,      -- Culture per turn
    yields_production,   -- Production capacity
    buildings,           -- Infrastructure development
    districts,           -- Specialized districts
    total_score,         -- Overall game score
    created_at           -- Game session identification
FROM civ_game_data 
WHERE game_turn <= 20;
```

## üß† **ML Model Design**

### **Model Type: Random Forest Classifier**
**Why Random Forest:**
- ‚úÖ Handles mixed data types (population, yields, counts)
- ‚úÖ Provides feature importance rankings
- ‚úÖ Robust to outliers and missing data
- ‚úÖ Interpretable results for strategy insights

### **Prediction Target:**
```python
# Binary classification: Will this civilization win the game?
target = 'will_win'  # 1 if final rank = 1, 0 otherwise

# Alternative: Multi-class ranking prediction
target = 'final_ranking'  # 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th place
```

### **Feature Engineering:**
```python
features = {
    # Raw metrics
    'turn_20_cities': 'num_cities',
    'turn_20_population': 'population', 
    'turn_20_techs': 'techs',
    'turn_20_science_yield': 'yields_science',
    'turn_20_culture_yield': 'yields_culture',
    'turn_20_buildings': 'buildings',
    
    # Calculated ratios (more predictive)
    'science_per_city': 'yields_science / num_cities',
    'population_per_city': 'population / num_cities',
    'buildings_per_city': 'buildings / num_cities',
    'development_index': '(techs + civics) / game_turn',
    
    # Relative positioning
    'science_rank_turn_20': 'rank() over (partition by game_turn order by yields_science desc)',
    'cities_rank_turn_20': 'rank() over (partition by game_turn order by num_cities desc)',
    'score_rank_turn_20': 'rank() over (partition by game_turn order by total_score desc)'
}
```

===============================================================
ETHIOPIA         67.3%              46               Science Leader
GAUL             23.1%              37               Balanced Growth  
CREE             5.2%               35               Strong Cities
MALI             2.8%               0                Production Focus
INDONESIA        1.4%               0                Early Struggle
OTTOMAN          0.2%               0                Behind in Tech
```

### **2. Feature Importance Analysis**
```
Most Predictive Turn 20 Metrics:
1. Science Rank (34.2% importance) - Science leadership crucial
2. Total Score (18.7% importance) - Early score advantage matters
3. Number of Cities (12.3% importance) - Expansion critical
4. Technologies (9.8% importance) - Tech advancement key
5. Science Yield (8.1% importance) - Raw science output
```

### **3. Strategic Insights**
```python
# Model reveals winning patterns:
if science_rank <= 2 and num_cities >= 4:
    win_probability = 0.78  # 78% chance of victory
    
if science_rank >= 5:
    win_probability = 0.09  # Only 9% chance of comeback
    
# Critical thresholds discovered:
- 4+ cities by Turn 20 = 65% win rate
- Top 2 science by Turn 20 = 71% win rate  
- Both conditions = 85% win rate
```
